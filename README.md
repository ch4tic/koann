# project koann!

Text recognition algorithm implementation using Tesseract.

1. Git clone the project.
2. Download languages you'd like to use from: ***https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata***
3. Move downloaded languages to: ```/usr/share/tessdata/``` (if on Linux) and ```C:/Program Files/Tesseract-OCR/``` (if on Windows).
4. Use pip to install all modules required (go into ```koann/src/``` and run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```).
5. Run the program: ```python3 main.py```

**Note that you should have the tree command installed on your preffered OS.** 

**You also have some languages we've added in "/lang/" folder**

Syntax for Linux Arch(btw I use Arch): ```pacman -S tree``` 

Syntax for Linux Debian: ```apt-get install tree```

Syntax for OS X: ```brew install tree```

For Windows ```tree``` is ***already installed***
